# Crestron-Home-Assistant-Integration-Example

This is an example of bi-directional integration of a Crestron system with Home Assistant.
This is based on the integration drive developed by Nick Pope and then enhanced by Georges Khalil
Nick's original driver can be found here: https://github.com/npope/home-assistant-crestron-component
Georges's fork, that I used, can be found here: https://github.com/georgesak/home-assistant-crestron-component
